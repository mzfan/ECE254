1. 
Non-idle task IDs will be on index [n-1] of the active_TCB array.

2.
- p_lnk is the link pointer for ready/semaphore wait list.

- ts_stack is the stack pointer to the current task.

- Yes, casting the pointer for XCB to TCB should keep the p_lnk field.

3.
mp_tcb and mp_stk are the memory pools for the TCB and system stack allocations.

4.
- The registers saved to stack are R0-R12,LR,xPSR,PC
- bit15 to bit2 of os_stackinfo contains the size of the stack.
- Take the memory address of the stack pointer then add the size of the stack (x 4)
- PSP contains the pointer to the stack containing not running processes
- MSP contains the stack pointer to running processes (tsk_stack in OS_TCB contains the address to R13)
